## Installation
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Clone
First clone the project, open it in Android Studio and get all required dependencies.

### Firebase setup
Since the project is using Firebase Services, we need to set up a project in Firebase.
Follow the steps below to set up a Firebase project and connect the app with it.

Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/),
log in and create a project.
You may choose any name you like for the project.

Once the project is created, we need to connect the app.
Start by clicking the android button in the Overview page.

![Step1](/docs/step1.jpg?raw=true)

Package name is `com.careapps.bucketlist`, nickname is anything you like.

Because the app uses Google Sign-In, we must also set a certificate SHA-1 hash.
To find it, go back to Android Studio and open the android project inside the flutter app

![Step2](/docs/step2.jpg?raw=true)

To find the signing certificate hash, execute the signingReport gradle task

![Step3](/docs/step3.jpg?raw=true)

In the output, find the debug cert and copy it's SHA-1 hash and paste it to firebase.

![Step4](/docs/step4.jpg?raw=true)

The first step in firebase should look something like this

![Step5](/docs/step5.jpg?raw=true)

Click **Register app** and download the `google-services.json` file that's given in the next step.

Open the Flutter app in Android Studio again and place `google-services.json` to `bucket_list/android/app/` folder.

![Step6](/docs/step6.jpg?raw=true)

Finish the app setup in Firebase, by pressing **Next** a couple of times.

Next we need to enable Google sign-in and Cloud Firestore.
Go to **Authentication** and click `Set up sign-in method`.
Then click on **Google**, enable it, set a support email and save.

![Step7](/docs/step7.jpg?raw=true)

Lastly, let's enable Cloud Firestore.

Go to **Database** and click **Create database**.
Select **Start in test mode** and hit **Next**.
Select whichever location you prefer and click **Done**

With that, the Firebase setup is complete and you are ready to run the app.
Make sure your phone is connected to your computer and in Android Studio hit `Shift+F10` to build and run the app.

If you get a Cloud Firebase error about requiring an index, follow the link given by the error message.
